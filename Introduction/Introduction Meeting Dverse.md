* Start by exploring the opportunities within this project. (Thursday delivery, 22-02-2024)
* [Getting to know each other, specifically for this project something like a CV](About%20Me.md).
* Get a basic knowledge about the concepts within the project.
	* [[Activity Pub]]
	* [[JSON-LD]]
	* [[URI]]
	* [[Databases]]
	* Design/architecture docs for existing fediverse apps.
	* Cloud
	* Games
	* What do you need?
* [Come up with some user stories / user story's of the flow of the application.](Dverse%20User%20Story%20&%20Application%20Flow.md)

	* A freeform text that describes a user story.

Each student will study a certain type of subject that he wants to become more proficient in. At the end of the first week these study's will be shared with each other.

## Activity Pub & JSON-LD
The activity pub is a decentralized communication protocol made for communicating on the web. With this technology you can communicate from one server to another.

https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/

It uses JSON-LD (JSON Linked) for communicating, which basically is normal JSON but can contain URI's. It is annotated like normal JSON but with an @ sign in front of it.

## Databases
There are different type of database each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The most commonly used one is a relational database like SQL.

Besides this there is something called an non-relation database that is good at storing large amounts of JSON like MongoDB. This type of database is called NoSQL.

Then there is a type of database that is good at storing large amounts of data in graph format, this kind of database is called GraphQL.

When talking about bots there is yet another database that gets used more often. This database is called a Vector database. In this database the data is stored as a mathematical representations.
