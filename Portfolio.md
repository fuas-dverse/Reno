# Introduction
In my sixth semester at Fontys Eindhoven we had to choose one of the four available group projects. The project I choose is called "Collaborating Bots" the goal of this project is to create a decentralized piece of software where multiple individual agents can work together to achieve a goal. For example: "I want to book a hotel in Spain close Torrente de Pareis, that has at least an average of three star reviews and has to be the cheapest one." To achieve this task there will be multiple steps involved like searching for hotels near the place, checking the prices, checking the revies and booking. Al these tasks will be an induvial agent that works together with the rest to achieve the goal.
