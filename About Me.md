# About Me
My name is Reno Muijsenberg, I am 21 years old, and I live in Maasbree, which is located in the Netherlands. In my spare time, I am often with friends, in the gym, working with computers or when the time allows it travelling.  
  
Currently, I am starting my 3rd year at Fontys in Eindhoven, where I am learning to become a software developer. Prior to this education, I studied at ROC Ter AA in Helmond as an Application- and Media Developer at MBO-4, and I obtained a diploma for this.  
  
Initially, I was considering becoming a cook or a software developer, but since I was always more interested in computers when I was younger, I chose to pursue the IT direction. My interest in computers was already noticed by my parents when I was trying to figure out what I could do on my grandmaâ€™s Windows XP computer.
