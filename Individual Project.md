A social media platform kind of like Instagram, it would feature some basic social media stuff like: uploading posts, uploading images, having friend, likes, follows etc.

Challenges:

- Host on the cloud             (Cloud Native)
- Cloud image storage        (Cloud Native)
- ‘Big’ user based                 (Scalable Architectures)
- Multiple environments      (DevOps)
- CI/CD pipelines                 (DevOps)

# Combined Idea
For this idea, we create the social media platform that allows user to use it like a normal social media platform, but allows creators or celebrity's to host ticket events on the feed of users.

For example: when I follow Martin Garrix, he will be able to host an event that has a time lock on it. When the time lock expires users will be able to buy a ticket for the event.
